Every March, 68 college basketball teams enter a tournament and millions of people fill out brackets convinced they've figured it out. Most of them haven't. Even the most informed fans rarely get more than 60% of games right.

So I decided to ask a different question: **what does the data actually say about who wins — and can a machine learning model do better than conventional wisdom?**

*For the full methodology, models, and evaluation, see the [technical report →](/projects/predicting-the-madness-report).*

## The Data

I pulled historical NCAA tournament and regular season data going back to 2003 — over 120,000 games worth of box scores, seeds, and outcomes from the Kaggle *March Machine Learning Mania* competition. The dataset includes every Division I regular season game and every tournament game since 2003, along with third-party rankings like KenPom.

## What the Data Actually Shows

Before touching any model, the numbers tell an interesting story.

**Seeds matter — but not as much as you'd think.**

1-seeds win about 85% of their first-round games. But by the Sweet 16, the gap narrows fast. A 5-seed and a 3-seed have played nearly the same number of tournament games historically. The chart below (from the notebook EDA) shows win rate by seed across all tournament rounds since 2003 — notice how quickly the advantage flattens out past seed 4.

**Games are close.** Nearly 29% of all tournament games since 2003 were decided by 5 points or fewer. The average winning margin is only 12 points. That means a lot of outcomes come down to a few possessions — which no model can reliably predict.

## How I Built the Model

Rather than feeding raw stats into a model, I engineered features that measure *relative* team strength — how much better or worse is Team A compared to Team B on each dimension? This includes:

- **Net efficiency** — the gap between points scored and allowed per possession
- **Effective field goal percentage** — accounts for the extra value of 3-pointers
- **Turnover rate** — teams that take care of the ball consistently go further
- **Offensive rebound rate** — second-chance points matter in close games
- **Strength of schedule** — beating bad teams all year isn't the same as competing in a tough conference
- **Seed difference** — still a strong signal, since it reflects expert judgment from the selection committee

I tested four models: **Logistic Regression**, **K-Nearest Neighbors**, **Random Forest**, and **XGBoost**, then compared them on accuracy, log loss, and ROC-AUC.

## How Well Does It Work?

Short answer: better than chance, but not perfect.

| Model | Accuracy (2025 Tournament) | ROC-AUC |
|---|---|---|
| Logistic Regression | 76.1% | 0.869 |
| K-Nearest Neighbors | 85.1% | 0.881 |
| Random Forest | 73.9% | 0.883 |
| XGBoost | 75.4% | 0.848 |

On the 2025 tournament — data the model had never seen — all four models beat the 50% coin-flip baseline by a wide margin. The **Random Forest** was selected as the best performer based on log loss, which measures not just whether the model picked the right winner but how *confident* it was.

The model is good at picking expected winners. It's not good at picking 12-over-5 upsets — and neither is anyone else.

## What Actually Wins in March?

According to the feature importance analysis, the factors that matter most are:

1. **Seed difference** — by far the strongest predictor. The selection committee's judgment about team quality is hard to beat.
2. **Strength of schedule** — teams that earned their record against tough competition hold up better in March
3. **Net efficiency** — the gap between points scored and allowed per possession; the best efficiency-based predictor
4. **Offensive efficiency** — scoring efficiently matters more than scoring a lot

What matters less than people think: free throw rate and defensive rebounding in isolation. It's the combination of seed, schedule strength, and efficient play that separates tournament teams.

## Why This Matters

This isn't just about basketball brackets. The same framework — using relative performance metrics to predict head-to-head outcomes — applies broadly in sports analytics, business competition modeling, and any domain where two entities compete on measurable dimensions. The result shows that efficiency-based metrics consistently outperform simple win-loss records as predictors, which has real implications for how teams are evaluated and seeded.

For March Madness specifically: the model confirms that seed is meaningful but not deterministic. Roughly 1 in 3 games is genuinely a toss-up based on the numbers. That's not a flaw in the model — that's March Madness.

## How Did the Model Actually Do in 2026?

Across the full 2026 tournament — 59 main bracket games the model had never seen — the Random Forest correctly predicted **46 of 59 matchups (78.0%)**.

| Round | Correct | Total | Accuracy |
|---|---|---|---|
| Round of 64 | 23 | 28 | 82% |
| Round of 32 | 12 | 16 | 75% |
| Sweet 16 | 5 | 8 | 62% |
| Elite Eight | 3 | 4 | 75% |
| Final Four | 2 | 2 | 100% |
| Championship | 1 | 1 | 100% |
| **Total** | **46** | **59** | **78.0%** |

The model was sharpest in the first round, where seed gaps are largest and favorites almost always win. It got shakier in the Sweet 16 — exactly where the bracket gets genuinely unpredictable — then finished strong, correctly predicting both Final Four games and the championship. **Michigan** defeated UConn 69–63 to win the 2026 national title, and the model had Michigan winning it all.
